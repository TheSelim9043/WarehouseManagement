# WarehouseManagement
This is the website of a warehouse which I created using PHP.


 First ,download " XAMPP " then  start Apache and MySQL from XAMPP. Then  open NetBeans Apache and after that, in Chrome browser,
 paste this URL : " http://localhost/warehouse_management_37044/index.php "
 
 After that create a password and username , with that you can log in ( in case of forgotten password, user can change it in login page ) , in the site you can add customer,
 item and you can see the item stocks in search button as well as with all the customers ( including customer's information ) . Write " localhost " in Chrome browser, you 
 will see "phpmyadmin " there, click it In phpmyadmin, "warehousemanagement" all of this can be seen.
 
 Additionaly, in order for this whole process to work, export the SQLDatabase from the phpmyadmin. In phpymadmin , click " warehousemanagement" then click SQL then click " export " and download the file. File should be called " warehouse_management_37044.sql "
 
 after all that , the project is ready. 
 
 The  " warehouse_management_37044.sqL " file is in the repository.
